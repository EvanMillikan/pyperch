## Getting Started

### About
pyperch - Neural Network Weight Optimization, has been developed to support students taking Georgia Tech’s graduate computer science machine learning course. 
pyperch implements three random optimization algorithms—Randomized Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithm—which can be used as drop-in replacements for traditional gradient-based optimizers in PyTorch.
### Install 

pip install pyperch.   

```
pip install pyperch
```

For starter code and examples, see [pyperch/notebooks](notebooks/).
