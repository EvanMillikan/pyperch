## Getting Started

### About
Pyperch is a neural network weight optimization package developed to support students taking Georgia Tech’s graduate machine learning course CS7641. 
Three random optimization algorithms—randomized hill climbing, simulated annealing, and a genetic algorithm—can be used as drop-in replacements for traditional gradient-based optimizers in PyTorch.
### Install 

pip install pyperch.   

```
pip install pyperch
```

For starter code and examples, see [pyperch/notebooks](notebooks).
